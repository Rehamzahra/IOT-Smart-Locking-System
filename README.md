### A face recognition smart locking system is an advanced security solution that utilizes technology to grant access to individuals based on their facial features. This system employs a combination of hardware and software components to accurately identify and authenticate individuals in real-time.
### This project aims to improve the experience of security in homes, locks, etc. In addition to helping the elderly and handicapped with giving them an advanced feature.

### We use **ESP32-CAM module** as a main hardware component in our project. **ESP32-CAM** is a very small camera module with the ESP32-S chip and support WIFI. The AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM module comes with an ESP32-S chip, a very small size camera and a micro-SD card slot. Micro SD card slot can be used to store images taken from the camera or to store files.This ESP32-CAM module can be widely used in various IoT applications like face detection system. ESP32-CAM module also has several GPIO pins to connect the external hardware.
